# Aerospike restore (asrestore)
Aerospike Restore CLI tool. This page describes capabilities and configuration options of the Aerospike restore tool, `asrestore`.

## Overview
`asrestore` restores backups created with `asbackup`. With the `asrestore` tool, you can restore to specific bins or sets, secure connections using username/password credentials or TLS (or both), and use configuration files to automate restore operations.

## Considerations for Aerospike restore
When using `asrestore`, be aware of the following considerations:

- The TTL of restored keys is preserved, but the last-update-time and generation count are reset to the current time.
- `asrestore` creates records from the backup. If records exist in the namespace on the cluster, you can configure a write policy to determine whether the backup records or the records in the namespace take precedence when using `asrestore`.
- If a restore transaction fails, you can configure timeout options for retries.
- Restore is cluster-configuration-agnostic. A backup can be restored to a cluster of any size and configuration. Restored data is evenly distributed among cluster nodes, regardless of cluster configuration.

## Privileges required for `asrestore`
The privileges required to run `asrestore` depend on the type of objects in the namespace.

- If the namespace does not contain [user-defined functions](https://aerospike.com/docs/database/learn/architecture/udf) or [secondary indexes](https://aerospike.com/docs/database/learn/architecture/data-storage/secondary-index), `read-write` is the minimum necessary privilege.
- If the namespace contains [user-defined functions](https://aerospike.com/docs/database/learn/architecture/udf), `udf-admin` is the minimum necessary privilege to restore UDFs for Database 6.0 or newer. Otherwise, use `data-admin`.
- If the namespace contains [secondary indexes](https://aerospike.com/docs/database/learn/architecture/data-storage/secondary-index), `sindex-admin` is the minimum necessary privilege to restore secondary indexes for Database 6.0 or newer. Otherwise, use `data-admin`.

      --auth INTERNAL,EXTERNAL,PKI                                                                  The authentication mode used by the Aerospike server. INTERNAL 
                                                                                                    uses standard user/pass. EXTERNAL uses external methods (like LDAP) 
                                                                                                    which are configured on the server. EXTERNAL requires TLS. PKI allows 
                                                                                                    TLS authentication and authorization based on a certificate. No

      --tls-enable                                                                                  Enable TLS authentication with Aerospike. If false, other TLS 
                                                                                                    options are ignored.
      --tls-name string                                                                             The server TLS context to use to authenticate the connection to 
                                                                                                    Aerospike.
      --tls-cafile env-b64:<cert>,b64:<cert>,<cert-file-name>                                       The CA used when connecting to Aerospike.
      --tls-capath <cert-path-name>                                                                 A path containing CAs for connecting to Aerospike.
      --tls-certfile env-b64:<cert>,b64:<cert>,<cert-file-name>                                     The certificate file for mutual TLS authentication with 
                                                                                                    Aerospike.
      --tls-keyfile env-b64:<cert>,b64:<cert>,<cert-file-name>                                      The key file used for mutual TLS authentication with Aerospike.
      --tls-keyfile-password "env-b64:<env-var>,b64:<b64-pass>,file:<pass-file>,<clear-pass>"       The password used to decrypt the key file if encrypted.
      --tls-protocols "[[+][-]all] [[+][-]TLSv1] [[+][-]TLSv1.1] [[+][-]TLSv1.2] [[+][-]TLSv1.3]"   Set the TLS protocol selection criteria. This format is the same 
                                                                                                    as Apache's SSLProtocol documented at 
                                                                                                    https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_ssl.html#ssl protocol. (default +TLSv1.2)
      --client-timeout int         Initial host connection timeout duration. The timeout when opening a connection
                                   to the server host for the first time. (default 30000)
      --client-idle-timeout int    Idle timeout. Every time a connection is used, its idle
                                   deadline will be extended by this duration. When this deadline is reached,
                                   the connection will be closed and discarded from the connection pool.
                                   The value is limited to 24 hours (86400s).
                                   It's important to set this value to a few seconds less than the server's proto-fd-idle-ms
                                   (default 60000 milliseconds or 1 minute), so the client does not attempt to use a socket
                                   that has already been reaped by the server.
                                   Connection pools are now implemented by a LIFO stack. Connections at the tail of the
                                   stack will always be the least used. These connections are checked for IdleTimeout
                                   on every tend (usually 1 second).
                                   
      --client-login-timeout int   Specifies the login operation timeout for external authentication methods such as LDAP. (default 10000)

Restore Flags:
  -d, --directory string         The directory that holds the backup files. Required, unless --input-file is used.
  -n, --namespace string         Used to restore to a different namespace. Example: source-ns,destination-ns
  -s, --set string               Only restore the given sets from the backup.
                                 Default: restore all sets.
  -B, --bin-list string          Only restore the given bins in the backup.
                                 If empty, include all bins.
  -R, --no-records               Don't restore any records.
  -I, --no-indexes               Don't restore any secondary indexes.
      --no-udfs                  Don't restore any UDFs.
  -w, --parallel int             The number of restore threads. Accepts values from 1-1024 inclusive.
                                 If not set, the default value is automatically calculated and appears as the number of CPUs on your machine.
  -L, --records-per-second int   Limit total returned records per second (rps).
                                 Do not apply rps limit if records-per-second is zero.
      --max-retries int          Maximum number of retries before aborting the current transaction. (default 5)
      --total-timeout int        Total transaction timeout in milliseconds. 0 - no timeout. (default 10000)
      --socket-timeout int       Socket timeout in milliseconds. If this value is 0, it's set to --total-timeout.
                                 If both this and --total-timeout are 0, there is no socket idle time limit. (default 10000)
      --nice int                 The limits for read/write storage bandwidth in MiB/s.
                                 Default is 0 (no limit). (DEPRECATED: use --bandwidth instead)
  -N, --bandwidth int            The limits for read/write storage bandwidth in MiB/s.
                                 Default is 0 (no limit).
  -i, --input-file string         Restore from a single backup file. Use - for stdin.
                                  Required, unless --directory or --directory-list is used.
                                  
      --directory-list string     A comma-separated list of paths to directories that hold the backup files. Required,
                                  unless -i or -d is used. The paths may not contain commas.
                                  Example: 'asrestore --directory-list /path/to/dir1/,/path/to/dir2'
                                  
      --parent-directory string   A common root path for all paths used in --directory-list.
                                  This path is prepended to all entries in --directory-list.
                                  Example: 'asrestore --parent-directory /common/root/path
                                  --directory-list /path/to/dir1/,/path/to/dir2'
                                  
  -u, --unique                    Skip modifying records that already exist in the namespace.
  -r, --replace                   Fully replace records that already exist in the namespace.
                                  This option still performs a generation check by default and needs to be combined with the -g option
                                  if you do not want to perform a generation check.
                                  This option is mutually exclusive with --unique.
  -g, --no-generation             Don't check the generation of records that already exist in the namespace.
      --ignore-record-error       Ignore errors specific to records, not UDFs or indexes. The errors are:
                                  AEROSPIKE_RECORD_TOO_BIG,
                                  AEROSPIKE_KEY_MISMATCH,
                                  AEROSPIKE_BIN_NAME_TOO_LONG,
                                  AEROSPIKE_ALWAYS_FORBIDDEN,
                                  AEROSPIKE_FAIL_FORBIDDEN,
                                  AEROSPIKE_BIN_TYPE_ERROR,
                                  AEROSPIKE_BIN_NOT_FOUND.
                                  By default, these errors are not ignored and asrestore terminates.
      --disable-batch-writes      Disables the use of batch writes when restoring records to the Aerospike cluster.
                                  By default, the cluster is checked for batch write support. Only set this flag if you explicitly
                                  don't want batch writes to be used or if asrestore is failing to work because it cannot recognize
                                  that batch writes are disabled.
                                  
      --max-async-batches int     To send data to Aerospike Database, asrestore creates write workers that work in parallel.
                                  This value is the number of workers that form batches and send them to the database.
                                  For Aerospike Database versions prior to 6.0, 'batches' are only a logical grouping of records,
                                  and each record is uploaded individually.
                                  The true max number of async Aerospike calls would then be <max-async-batches> * <batch-size>.
                                   (default 32)
      --warm-up int               Warm Up fills the connection pool with connections for all nodes. This is necessary for batch restore.
                                  By default is calculated as (--max-async-batches + 1), as one connection per node is reserved
                                  for tend operations and is not used for transactions.
                                  
      --batch-size int            The max allowed number of records to simultaneously upload to Aerospike.
                                  Default is 128 with batch writes enabled. If you disable batch writes,
                                  this flag is superseded because each worker sends writes one by one.
                                  All three batch flags are linked. If --disable-batch-writes=false,
                                  asrestore uses batch write workers to send data to the database.
                                  Asrestore creates a number of workers equal to --max-async-batches that work in parallel,
                                  and form and send a number of records equal to --batch-size to the database.
                                   (default 128)
      --extra-ttl int             For records with expirable void-times, add N seconds of extra-ttl to the
                                  recorded void-time.
                                  
  -T, --timeout int               Set the timeout (ms) for asinfo commands sent from asrestore to the database.
                                  The info commands are to check version, get indexes, get udfs, count records, and check batch write support. (default 10000)
      --retry-base-timeout int    Set the initial timeout for a retry in milliseconds when data is sent to the Aerospike database
                                  during a restore. This retry sequence is triggered by the following non-critical errors:
                                  AEROSPIKE_NO_AVAILABLE_CONNECTIONS_TO_NODE,
                                  AEROSPIKE_TIMEOUT,
                                  AEROSPIKE_DEVICE_OVERLOAD,
                                  AEROSPIKE_NETWORK_ERROR,
                                  AEROSPIKE_SERVER_NOT_AVAILABLE,
                                  AEROSPIKE_BATCH_FAILED,
                                  AEROSPIKE_MAX_ERROR_RATE.
                                  This base timeout value is also used as the interval multiplied by --retry-multiplier to increase
                                  the timeout value between retry attempts. (default 1000)
      --retry-multiplier float    Increases the delay between subsequent retry attempts for the errors listed under --retry-base-timeout.
                                  The actual delay is calculated as: retry-base-timeout * (retry-multiplier ^ attemptNumber) (default 1)
      --retry-max-retries uint    Set the maximum number of retry attempts for the errors listed under --retry-base-timeout.
                                  The default is 0, indicating no retries will be performed
      --validate                  Validate backup files without restoring.

Compression Flags:
  -z, --compress string         Enables decompressing of backup files using the specified compression algorithm.
                                This must match the compression mode used when backing up the data.
                                Supported compression algorithms are: zstd, none
                                Set the zstd compression level via the --compression-level option. (default "NONE")
      --compression-level int   zstd compression level. (default 3)

Encryption Flags:
      --encrypt string                 Enables decryption of backup files using the specified encryption algorithm.
                                       This must match the encryption mode used when backing up the data.
